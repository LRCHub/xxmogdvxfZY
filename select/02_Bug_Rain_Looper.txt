Bug rain,
Listen to all the bugs rain
Rain on the van, and watch James
Trying to stay awake.

We're shaking,
Just as the storm is breaking,
And James is hallucinating
Trying to stay awake.

In the rain and the rain and the rain and the rain,
Rain and the rain and the rain and the rain,
Rain and the rain and the rain and all the
Bug Rain.

We know
We're two hundred miles from Fargo,
And we tune into the radio
Trying to stay awake.

Yawning
Through the tornado warning,
Driving towards the morning,
Trying to stay awake.

In the rain and the rain and the rain and the rain,
Rain and the rain and the rain and the rain,
Rain and the rain and the rain and all the
Bug Rain.

In the rain and the rain and the rain and the rain,
The rain and the rain and the rain and the rain,
The rain and the rain and the rain and all the
Bug Rain.
