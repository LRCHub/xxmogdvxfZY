No time for dreaming
My husband isn't here
This place, this place is what
I was looking for
We go for a walk in the park
Before it's getting dark
We've got everything but I want more, more, more, more
Chorus;
Everybody wants to get our heads
Between high and the low
C'est la vie de Château
Everybody wants to get our heads
Between high and the low
C'est la vie de Château
No time for dreaming
Once I was a queen
Forever it is a long, long time
We don't talk but it's fine
We go for a walk in the park
This place is falling apart
He doesn't love me, no anymore more, more, more
[Chorus]
[...]
[Chorus]
