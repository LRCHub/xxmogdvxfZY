Hunt in the garden of false opportunity
I am the bug in this global community
Ravage your conscience with total impunity
I am the bug in this global community
Seek and provoke degradation and lunacy
I am the bug in this global community
Go tell your new God to beware of my heresy
I am the bug in this global community
When all of our minds collide
You will confide
Everyone stays inside
Penniless golden rush
Government hush
Billions of souls in the crush
Open the heavenly gates
Nobody waits
Nobody contemplates
We are a cog in the wheel
Cut us a deal
What are we supposed to feel?
Automate all of the fears
Scan our tears
We are my eyes and ears
See how the lovers click
Totem to pick
Monitor sexual rhetoric
Up in the swelling storm
You can be born
After we fill out the form
Remotely feed my desire
Intimate liar
Take evolution higher
Take evolution higher
Hunt in the garden of false opportunity
I am the bug in this global community
Ravage your conscience with total impunity
I am the bug in this global community
Seek and provoke degradation and lunacy
I am the bug in this global community
Go tell your new God to beware of my heresy
I am the bug in this global community
Sympathy caught en masse
Footage of blast
Triggers petition and cash
Every iota retained
Hacked up and chained
Personal details ingrained
Making immortal the ages
Who sort through the pages
Searching for vaudeville's and wages
Blindly embrace the tsunami
New York to Malawi
Identity Kamikaze
Take evolution higher
Hunt in the garden of false opportunity
I am the bug in this global community
Ravage your conscience with total impunity
I am the bug in this global community
Seek and provoke degradation and lunacy
I am the bug in this global community
Go tell your new God to beware of my heresy
I am the bug in this global community
